Casey oversees the vision and mission for Redeemer City. He will be the primary vision caster and implementer and ensures that we are striving toward the overarching vision for the church. These responsibilities include analyzing where our church is at and where we need to go, not only so we don’t drift from our mission, but so that we continually use our gifts to reach our community, city and world.
